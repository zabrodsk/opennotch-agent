## Features

- **Notch UI** — Animated overlay that expands from the MacBook notch
- **Live Session Monitoring** — Track multiple Claude Code and Codex sessions in real-time
- **Permission Approvals** — Approve or deny tool executions directly from the notch
- **Chat History** — View full conversation history with markdown rendering
- **Auto-Setup** — Hooks install automatically on first launch

## Codex Integration (WIP)

- Codex sessions are discovered from `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl`
- The app normalizes Codex activity into the same session model used by Claude
- The expanded notch now groups active sessions into provider-specific cards (`Claude` orange, `Codex` blue gradient)
- Closed-notch activity shows provider identity (Claude crab, Codex logo, or both when mixed)
- Codex approval/question prompts are inferred from both `custom_tool_call` and `function_call` events (`ask_user`/`AskUserQuestion` included)
- Codex notch actions map to deterministic TUI shortcuts for tmux-backed sessions (`Approve: y`, `Reject: n`)
- Codex target routing now resolves by `tty`, `pid`, then `cwd` fallback for improved action reliability across concurrent sessions
- Expanded chat history now includes Codex conversation + tool-call timeline (parsed from Codex rollout JSONL), with provider-matched accents in chat indicators

## Requirements

- macOS 15.6+
- Claude Code CLI

## Install

Download the latest release or build from source:

```bash
xcodebuild -scheme ClaudeIsland -configuration Release build
```

## How It Works

Claude Island installs hooks into `~/.claude/hooks/` that communicate session state via a Unix socket. The app listens for events and displays them in the notch overlay.

When Claude needs permission to run a tool, the notch expands with approve/deny buttons—no need to switch to the terminal.

## Analytics

Claude Island uses Mixpanel to collect anonymous usage data:

- **App Launched** — App version, build number, macOS version
- **Session Started** — When a new Claude Code session is detected

No personal data or conversation content is collected.
